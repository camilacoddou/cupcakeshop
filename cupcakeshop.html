    <h3>Here is our story:</h3>
    <p>Seamus and Camila met a decade ago at a <span class="cupcake">cupcake</span> convention. They both
    love <span class="cupcake">cupcakes</span> so much but didn't feel there were enough queer <span class="cupcake">cupcake</span>
    flavors. So they started their own <span class="cupcake">cupcake</span> shop.</p>

    <p class="flashy">Cupcakes Are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Tasty</li>
      <li>Delicious</li>
      <li>Not Good For You!</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="sidebar">
    <h3>Here is a list of our queer cupcake flavors</h3>
