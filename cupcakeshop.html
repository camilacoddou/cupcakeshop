    <h3>Here is our story:</h3>
    <p>Seamus and Camila met a decade ago at a cupcake convention. They both
    love cupcakes so much but didn't feel there were enough queer cupcake
    flavors. So they started their own cupcake shop.</p>

    <h3>Here is a list of our queer cupcake flavors</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Purple Rain</li>
      <li>My Little Clonies</li>
      <li>U-Haul with Sprinkles</li>

      <li>Polyamory and Cream</li>
